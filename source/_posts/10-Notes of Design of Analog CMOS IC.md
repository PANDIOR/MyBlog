> This article will be a landmark in my blog. I want to note my life and study in English. SO let's begin! 

"Design of Analog CMOS Integrated  Circuits" which was written by Behzad Razavi is a very famous, magnificent, awesome book in IC learning.  People call it as BIBLE !!

# Chapter 1 Introduction to Analog Design

In this chapter, razavi tried to told us analog design remain have a essential position in our lives. Analog could be used in ADC and DAC, etc. AND that is why I want to learn analog IC instead of digital IC. Analog is the most interesting and beautiful thing in nature.

This chapter just a guidance. However, a picture in this chapter is very interesting and make me laugh.

This man doesn't have hair on his top of head. HHHHHHHHA , we usually call it as a professor's hairstyle, just like a Mediterranean, where a lake(head skin) surrounding by land(another hair).

okay, back to the real way.
